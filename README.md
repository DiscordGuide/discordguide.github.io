### Goals

What are our goals exactly...?
Well of course we want to grow and spread, but our main goal is to provide help for discord users and support other servers and create a community/network between the servers. 

We want to be a hub of discord activity that everyone enjoys, and where people can find ideas and help.

**We want to be an all around nice place to be.**

**Discord Partnered Project!**
