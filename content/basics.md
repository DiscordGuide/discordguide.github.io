# Basic Desktop Guides #
**Hello!** This is the first section, the Introduction to Discord.

I will cover some stuff in the tutorial as well as some other basic information that isn't included. Writing a guide to discord was a big task, but the goal is to make discord easier to use for everyone!

### **Intro** #
So what is Discord? Discord is a site/program that is basically a network of rooms that connect together like building blocks or legos. You can stack them in different orders, pick which ones you choose to add to your list and remove ones you don’t want anymore. Each server (chat room) is like a specific lego creation: the permissions are different blocks and it all ties together to create this amazing chat site.
I think of Discord like a house with all it’s various rooms, and your designing how you want it to be laid out!

So you are probably wondering, "What are you going to cover in an Intro to discord?"
Well, I thought I could cover the basics, and go over all the features you have outside servers.

### **Direct Messaging** #

So the first thing you'll notice on discord is you can directly message people.
Upon joining discord, if you didn't follow a server link you'll be staring at a blank channel saying you have no friends and no messages :cry:

Upon joining your friend server you can friend people and when you right click people on PC it'll allow you to 'DM' them, this is Direct Message or as it called on other chat rooms 'Private Messaging' or 'Whispers' this allows you to talk to people with no one else reading.

### **Friend Requests** #

The second thing that stands out on your discord when you join is the Friend area. As you go around discord meeting people, your friends list allows you to more easily keep track of those people who you connect with or work on stuff with. 

Perks: Being friends with someone gives you some special perks
* You can message them even if you don't share servers!
* You can get some cool abilities to do stuff with them.. Like Group Direct Messaging!

### **Group Direct Messaging** #

So you are in servers, but what if you want to **just** message 2 or 3 people and have no one else involved? Well if all of them are your friends you can add them to a "Group Message" which is like a small server that everyone is a Moderator of to some degree.

This allows more private conversations with friends.

### **Profiles** #

So you've noticed people have profiles? Well these profiles allow us to learn more about the user we are looking at. 
Features of the profile include:
* Notes (small sections on profiles where you can write stuff about them for reference)
* Connections (twitter, youtube, twitch, steam, battle.net, and league of legends)
* Mutual Servers (seeing servers you share with the other person)
* Mutual Friends (seeing friends you share with the other person)
* Issue Response (Blocking, Reporting, and Removing them as friends)

**This was a basic overview of all the discord features outside of servers. 

For the guide on all your user settings and settings just keep scrolling where I will discuss how to setup your account and from there do much more on Discord!**
