# Basic Guides #

**Times for the basics of Discord. Are you ready?**

Keep in mind that most of the information is focused around the Desktop Client, not the Browser. 
Some of this is still the same on browser, but not all. You can ask browser-related questions on our server if you still need help!

## **Desktop Introduction** #

**Hello!** This is the first section, the Introduction to Discord.

I will cover some stuff in the tutorial as well as some other basic information that isn't included. Writing a guide to discord was a big task, but the goal is to make discord easier to use for everyone!

#### _Intro_ #
So what is Discord? Discord is a site/program that is basically a network of rooms that connect together like building blocks or legos. You can stack them in different orders, pick which ones you choose to add to your list and remove ones you don’t want anymore. Each server (chat room) is like a specific lego creation: the permissions are different blocks and it all ties together to create this amazing chat site.
I think of Discord like a house with all it’s various rooms, and your designing how you want it to be laid out!

So you are probably wondering, "What are you going to cover in an Intro to discord?"
Well, I thought I could cover the basics, and go over all the features you have outside servers.

#### _Direct Messaging_ #

So the first thing you'll notice on discord is you can directly message people.
Upon joining discord, if you didn't follow a server link you'll be staring at a blank channel saying you have no friends and no messages... how sad.

Upon joining servers you can friend people and when you right click people on PC it'll allow you to 'DM' them, this is Direct Message or as it called on other chat rooms 'Private Messaging' or 'Whispers' this allows you to talk to people with no one else reading.

#### _Friend Requests_ #

The second thing that stands out on your discord when you join is the Friend area. As you go around discord meeting people, your friend's list allows you to more easily keep track of those people who you connect with or work on stuff with. 

Perks: Being friends with someone gives you some special perks
* You can message them even if you don't share servers!
* You can get some cool abilities to do stuff with them. Like Group Direct Messaging!

#### _Group Direct Messaging_ #

So you are in servers, but what if you want to **just** message 2 or 3 people and have no one else involved? Well if all of them are your friends you can add them to a "Group Message" which is like a small server that everyone is a Moderator of to some degree.

This allows more private conversations with friends.

#### _Profiles_ #

So you've noticed people have profiles? Well, these profiles allow us to learn more about the user we are looking at. 
Features of the profile include:
* Notes (small sections on profiles where you can write stuff about them for reference)
* Connections (twitter, youtube, twitch, steam, battle.net, and league of legends)
* Mutual Servers (seeing servers you share with the other person)
* Mutual Friends (seeing friends you share with the other person)
* Issue Response (Blocking, Reporting, and Removing them as friends)

**This was a basic overview of all the discord features outside of servers.**

**For the guide on all your user settings and settings just keep scrolling where I will discuss how to setup your account and from there do much more on Discord!**


## **Desktop User Settings!** #

**Ain't nobody gonna make me use the instruction manual for nothing, bertha!**
Well if you are here, that is obviously not you! 

Here we are in the next guide, "User Settings", which will cover your... User Settings. These names are pretty self-explanatory, aren't they? 

_Just zoom in on the images if needed_
If you have questions or need more details, ask the server!

#### _Your Account_ #

So first of all, to get into your user settings your need to click the gear by your name at the bottom left of your screen.

Once you've done that a window should pop up, the first tab on it is called "Account" this is your basic account settings. Your profile picture, username, email, and password.

You use this to setup your personal details.

#### _Connections_ #

Connections are your connections between your account and media. These include Twitch, YouTube, Battle.net, Skype, League of Legends, and Steam.
These allow friends to easier find you on/from those!

#### _Friends_ #

This section allows you to choose who can friend you, and how easily it is for them to friend you. This also could allow you to make it to where no one can friend you!

#### _Text & Images_ #

These settings allow you to customize what text and images do for your discord; like whether links show sites or images, whether emojis automatically get made from typing faces, and text to speech (TTS) playback.

#### _Voice_ #

These are your basic and advanced voice settings. You can decide input and output levels and other voice options like input sensitivity.

#### _Notifications_ #

Notifications? Well duh! these are the beeps, pings, noises, and flashes your discord does for things! This also allows you to decide if Text-To-Speech plays or not.

I consider this one of the most important areas of the User Settings.


#### _Keybinds_ #

Keybinds are different key commands you can use to do different things on discord, such as enable streamer mode or mute yourself. 

These are super useful if you don't want to manually do everything.

#### _Appearance_ #

This is my **favorite** user setting. This allows you to change how Discord looks and allows you to use Discord Developer mode (which allows you to copy user and message IDs, this helps with bot development i)

#### _Games_ #

The magical Games area. This allows you to view games you've played or that are on your computer and even rename some. Something a lot of people like to do is rename their games to something funny or something that has a meaning for them. (I do this to explain what I'm doing or working on usually)

#### _Overlay_ #

The overlay is what happens when you play a game, do you want discord to be able to show during the game? How do you want it to show? What notifications? and size.
Useful for gamers who still like to chat and check their servers.

#### _Locale_ #

Locale is a big area for lagging and voice chat settings. 
Your locale tells what language you are in and area, your location here will respond better with similar/same locations. 

In server this is huge, based on where the server is located will change your connection to the server. Most international servers do US-EAST as the main Location because it makes the server closer to more people.

#### _Streamer Mode_ #

Streamer mode is useful for those of us who like to stream to different media platforms. A lot of twitch streamers use discord so this is a big thing. When you stream it shows your icon as purple and shows what you are streaming or where you are streaming instead of your game.
This allows you to turn on the mode which tells discord to look for you streaming.

#### _Security_ #

Security, the big thing on discord. 
To avoid hackers you can enable 2FA (Two Factor Authentication) which can help prevent people from breaking into your account.
