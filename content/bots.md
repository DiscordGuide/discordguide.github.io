# **Bot Guides**

**We'll be covering some uses of bots, and how to start the basics of them as well.**
We will cover everything from types of bots, to uses, to basic setup and usage of a few bots!

## **Bots on Discord**

Hey, we’re here to talk to you about Bots!

Yeah Bots, those funny programs you see doing all sorts of things all around Discord! Ever wondered what others are out there and how to make them? That’s pretty much what these Bot guides are for! **Remember this, these guides are almost all for Desktop use!**

#### *Types and Uses of Bots*

**We have to start somewhere… and that somewhere is with the basics!**

“What are the types of bots?” You might ask, well I gave a rough idea in the server guides but here we’ll go a bit more in-depth.

  • **Moderation Bots**
These are bots that manage channels, add roles, kick people, and make sure people are following rules or allow you to deal with people who aren’t. Moderation bots can either be controlled by you, or can automatically do these things as neeeded which is called AutoMod. (Ex. On our server we use [Botwinder](http://botwinder.info))

 • **Media Bots**
Media bots are a type of bot that plays music, or providers certain images/gifs upon command. These bots center around different kinds of Media. (Ex. PvPCraft does music, and pokemon stats among many other things.)

 • **Chat Bots**
This breed of bot serves the purpose of posting messages, such as Cleverbot or a bot that replies to commands with a preset message. These bots are good for rule channels and having mindless dialogue. (Ex. A lot of bots have cleverbot, such as PvPCraft again.)

 • **Data Bots**
Data Bots… these bots record and send, or receive and record information. A bot like these could track people streaming on twitch, updates to a GitHub repo or give you stats on your server on a central site… as well as listing your server as mentioned in the server guides! (Ex. Trello bot allows you to have a trello feed on your server.)

 • **Misc Bots**
These bots can either do it all, or fit under a specific category that wasn't mentioned above. These bots can be a pretty tough cookie, or a lagging old thing. All depends on the hosting... which we'll discuss later.

#### *Creativity with Bots*

How you approach using bots is probably the best thing about it. Bots themselves are code that purposefully uses Discord's API so you can get what you want from them.

Like, if a bot can allow people to add roles to themselves... why not set up your notification roles to be self-addable instead of needing to have staff do it?
This trick can be used in so many ways to allow users to join/leave channels they want to be in and opt into notifications (Using an @events role instead of @here everytime is something we do.)

This can also be good when implimenting something like an automod bot... What will it do? How can it protect your server from spammers, abusing link posting, or even simple things like someone trying to advertise? Mods can rest easy knowing a reliable mod bot is on duty.

*(Another example of bots stealing jobs from dedicated workers! Wait, conspiracies are supposed to be saved for the VIP channels in the server...)*

#### *Where to find Bots*

Where to find bots! Well, you can use our partnered site, [Carbon](https://www.carbonitex.net/discord/bots) or you could wander around the "Discord Bots" [server](https://discord.gg/xbgUBZQ) or [site](https://bots.discord.pw/)

There are many different places to **find** bots, the issue is finding good reliable ones. You can always check in our server to see what the staff prefer... warning we could be a little biased, we are users of Discord ourselves you know!

#### *Recommended Bots*

## **Bot Usage**

We know we have our recommended bots and all... but how about some interesting guides on how to use these bad boys?

We know it isn't as easy and just adding a bot and it suddenly knowing what you want it to do, so how about we help you with some bot basics! **User Interface to the rescue!**

We're still writing these, bear with us!
