## Creating a Server
---

**_Hello there!_** Today i'm gonna show you guys how to create a server!

Creating a server can seem like a HUGE thing, but it has some pretty basic steps. Alot of how your server will do depends on how well it is set-up. Your idea, goal, and how well it is made are the keys to the server.

---
#### Step One

The first step in creating a server is coming up with an idea. Your magical dream server won't actually get anywhere until you can decide what to do with it. Servers tend to take off if the idea is more unique and appealing than if it is something more common and has nothing attractive about it to potential members. **(People don't usually join just because you ask nicely, I've tried it)**

---
#### Step Two

You have that idea? Awesome! Step Two time!

The second step in creating this magical thing is finding a few friends interested in the idea, run it past some people and see what they think. If enough people like it, then you can move to Step Three! Remember, member base is what makes most servers run!

---
#### **Step Three**

_Friends gave ya that Golden-Seal-Of-Approval!_

The third step is pretty simple, find the + circle at the bottom of your server list as shown below

once you find that circle click it, and this tab should pop up

from here simply click create, fill out the name, and click the circle where letters appear as you type the name to choose an icon

Once it's all done click the Create and... WOW! Here's your server!

Now head on down the page for the next steps!

## Setting Up
---

**Huh?** _What!?!?!? It's time already!?_

Fineeee, time to setup your beautiful server you created in the last guide!

Setting up a server is a good thing to do before even inviting anyone. Having a clean nice look with all your roles and channels in place makes the server **WAY** more appealing when your friends, and future members join this creation of yours!

---

#### Setting up Roles

So you are at this screen where everything's all blank ?? 

![]()

From here go to the three lines icon by the server name, and click them 

![]()
then click "Server Settings" and BOOM you have this popup where you can edit almost everything on your server in one place. 

![]()

From here the first thing I normally do is click **Roles** (this is what i'll show you right now) 

![]()

Roles are what decide what everyone on your server can do, from simple things like Emotes to major things like being able to edit the whole server.

Common roles I add as shown above are "Admin" "Mod" "Member" and "Visitor" these allow you to decide who has what permissions. The basic idea for these roles are…

*   An "Admin" will have all permissions, this is someone you trust to control anything on the server.
*   A "Mod" will have message remove permissions, etc. This is someone you expect to help control any potential behavioral issues.
*   "Member" someone who can maybe post pictures and links, while others cannot.
*   "Visitor" someone who hasn't been around long enough to be the other roles.

This role system allows you to keep the chat functioning without you, and have a benefits system for good behavior. Some servers are super specific or are for Roleplay and have roles built around that system but almost all servers have Admins, Mods, and Member type roles.

---

#### Setting up Channels

Now you got your roles figured out, here's the tricky part... **Channels**

Channels are where your members actually talk, this is where all the action happens. Each Channel has permissions you can set, and you can name them for their purposes.

Whether someone can or cannot do something goes in a specific order, it goes the "`@everyone`" permission first, then their specific role, and then their personal permissions. Example: if "everyone" has _denied read messages_, "Mod" has a _allow read messages_ but "Example Name" who has the "Mod" role has _deny read messages_, then "Example Name" will not see that channel.

Setting up the permissions look a lot similar to roles 

![]()

there are slight differences, but not much you'll notice.

#### Setting up Voice Channels

Voice channels? They are pretty much the same as Text channels except... instead of messaging permissions, this has voice permissions.

The row you saw missing from Text? Those go here. 

![]()

These permissions allow certain roles to be able to talk/hear on voice chat, or even mute/deafen others.

**Mute** **:** Can't talk on VC. **Deafen** **:** Can't hear on VC. **Move** **:** Can move a person from one VC to the other.

This ties a lot into music bots, but i'll explain that in the Bot guides ??

**The next guide awaits!**

## Basic Server Information
---

**Wait... Oh welcome back**

Hey, welcome to basic server information!

Now that you have a setup server, and got your basic roles going lets look at some more setup you can do!

---

#### Checking your Roles

So lets say you are making a server for a fandom, each different character you might like is a seperate role with that fandom characters' favorite color. How would you put all these together and keep a good role order?

Should your roles look like this? 

![]()

**No!** That picture shows a messy role setup that would make a hierarchy impossible, to keep a server functioning well you need a nice order to be set up, usually.
If you are going for organization, that wouldn’t do well for you.

A good way to do this is to put leadership roles on the top, and then you can organize the other by color, or even by alphabet. (OCD people... I feel your pain)

Once you've done this, it'll probably look like this. 

![]()

It's important that roles like "Admin" "Mod" and other leadership roles are at/near the top, a Moderator with a role below everyone else wouldn't be able to do anything besides delete messages and mute people on Voice Chat. The permissions system works in order, the higher the role, the higher the authority **NO MATTER WHAT PERMISSIONS ARE CLICKED**

If Admin has "Administrator" clicked, and Mod has "Manage Roles" clicked, but Admin is below Mod, then Mod can just give themselves Admin and Admin can't do anything to stop them. 

The "Administrator" permission is like clicking all of them, (so you don't need to click them all) but it doesn't allow people to skip the order of the roles.

---

#### Checking your Channels

Your channels permissions are also major as I said before, any role without "Administrator" permission clicked will have to follow any permissions set any channel. 

You could make Mod have every permission except "Administrator" but if the channels block all of them then the Mod is useless on that channel. 

![]()

A good practice on channels is to not add every role specifically, just set the roles permissions and then on each channel just click view for everyone and leave the rest of them Blank, not an X or a Check. This means all the permissions will be set exactly how they are in the roles. 

![]()

The above is only a problem if you make a hidden channel, like a Moderators only channel. 
To do this simply unclick view for everyone and click view on Moderators/Admins. 

Making one of these channels is one of the exceptions to the "You shouldn't manually add each role." rule. Manually setting these is usually smarter, so for example: mods can't delete other mods messages in this channel.

---
#### Checking your Voice Channels

Voice Channels can be a bit trickier than regular Channels, but the idea is pretty much the same. 
You shouldn't have to worry about any of the permissions as long as it isn't restricted to a role, if it is then you have to add all the roles that can access it. (Like a staff, or vip voice chat)

---
#### Rules and Welcome

This is a basic thing on a server, every server should have a Rules and Welcome unless the server is based around chaos, like a meme or shitpost server. 
The only reason I wouldn’t is if the rules are super obvious, or if you have none.

![]()

I will post more examples in the Server Management guides but these channels should only allow Admins and you, the owner, to talk. This allows you to post rules everyone can see.

**If you have any questions so far, just ask in the server!**

**If not head on down to the Server Management guides for more server advice, or the Bot guide for your Bot related information!**
