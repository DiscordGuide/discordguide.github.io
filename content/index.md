# Welcome

### Welcome to the **Discord Guide** 
Whether you are new to Discord, or a long time user... we are beyond happy you could visit us today!

**What are we?**
This is a community ran project on Discord!
We are a service ran discord users, like you, to help all people who may use Discord.

Our goal is to give everyone a place to enjoy, and find help with whatever they need help with when it comes to Discord... or even some things that are unrelated!
Our 24/7 support team, and other users in the community, are always here to help you!

**What are these _Guides_ I see...?**
Our guides are not quite done, but we are working on them as fast as a wumpus can roll! (Which if you didn't know, is very fast when things aren't in its way!)
IF you want to contribute to the process, please contact Jet#0038 on the server or visit our GitHub! (Link above)

I think that about wraps it up!
So please feel free to take a look through the guides you'll see above or visit our [server](https://discord.gg/zXsAHTd).

**Our guides are as follows...**
_You can find all the guides listed below on the blue toolbar at the top!_

* **Basics Guides** are the Basics to Discord, on Desktop or Mobile clients.

* **Desktop Guides** are the details of using Discord on Desktop, mostly focused on Servers.

* **Mobile Guides** are the uses of Mobile Discord for Servers, and what is different between it and the Desktop clients.

* **Bot Guides** go over the different types of bots in Discord, and how you might use them. We also cover the basics of making a bot.

* **Resource Guides** involve the resources on Discord, and tricks to using Discord. This somewhat includes our Video guides which can also be found at our [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCP5vVXFrOsIvh9vw_mOFTMg).


If you have any other questions, or feel you can contribute to our efforts then please join the support server mentioned above and talk to our staff. 
We don't bite, only the wumpus bites.

### _Have a beautiful time on Discord._
