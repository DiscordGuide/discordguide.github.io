# Hello there!

### Welcome to the **Discord Guide** 
Whether you are new to Discord or a long time user, we are glad you could visit today!

**What are we?**

We are a community ran project on Discord! Our goal is to be a friendly community where you find help with [Discord](https://discordapp.com) from a users perspective.

**What are these _Guides_ I see?**

Our guides are our way of giving to the community, a way to help users with direct access to information. 

**Our guides are as follows...** _You can find all the guides listed below on the blue toolbar at the top!_

* **Desktop Guides** are the details of using Discord on Desktop, this stops after the Basics.

* **Mobile Guides** go over Mobile Discord, such as the Basics or even basic stuff like Servers on Mobile.

* **Server Guides** go over Servers, this section is mostly focused towards Desktop... but in general it is about improving your server!

* **Bot Guides** go over the different types of bots in Discord, and how you might use them in a server! (Development covers the actual making of a bot)

* **Development Guides** cover different development tools, and things you can do with bots. Think of this as the basic tutorials to Bots, VPS's, and a little about similar resources.

* **Resource Guides** involve the resources on Discord, and tricks to using Discord. This somewhat includes our Video guides which can also be found at our [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCP5vVXFrOsIvh9vw_mOFTMg).


If you have any other questions, please visit our [server](https://discord.gg/zXsAHTd).
