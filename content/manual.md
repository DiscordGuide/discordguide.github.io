# **Information and Guidelines**

**This is where all the staff information and duty guidelines will be!**

_We will cover policy, the staff inner-workings (Chain of Command, and Departments) as well as the different guideslines for roles._

Make sure you are in our [Staff Server](https://discord.gg/), this is where we handle Interviews, Evaluations, and Staff Training.

On the same note, all staff channels will be moving over to this server as well, we don't want to cram your channel list with a ton of servers... but we want to make sure we have a clean main server!

## **Staff Policy Code**

**This section is your guy's #1 set of rules and policy around the server!**

Work Breaks
* As a Staff you are expected to take care of yourself first, if you've been working day after day make sure you take breaks.  Overwhelming yourself leads to negative things.

Activity
* As a Staff you are expected to maintain a decent amount of activity. We understand not being super chatty, but if you cannot maintain a few messages a day, you will be demoted.
* After a week of being semi-inactive you will be talked to, then warned/put on Pseudo, and then demotion.

Grievances
* If you have an issue with another Staff you need to bring it before one of the servers Admins, and it will be discussed and handled.

Reading back
* When doing support, or moderating if you come into a situation late you need to read back and see what you missed.

Patience
* When doing your duties you need to make sure you remain patient with the users, this doesn't mean you let them walk over you. Try to resolve it, if that doesn't work then go to the next steps.

Single Support
* When doing your duties do not add extra comments that dont help, or have no relevence. Make sure if someone has it under control you dont randomly interject, add information you think is vital when needed but don't cut each other off.

Roles
* When doing your duties do not add roles to yourself. If you dont have the right roles tell us.
Certain roles can assign roles, abusing this perm will lead to instant demotion.

**We understand emergencies, and things get in the way of activity. We just ask you keep us informed**

**This server is not a place to just claim credit for being staff and not do the work.**

# _**Staff Manuals**_

**This is the general staff manual! All staff need to read this, and the support manual but this will be mostly focused on general staff!** 

**If you want to step outside your job duties and assist, make sure you read the section for that department.**

#### **Chain of Command**

The key thing to working as a staff team is following our Chain of Command; things need to run in order of who does what.

**Here is our basic Chain of Command... or C.O.C.**

```
  Role                 Level
============================
* Admin                  1
* Department Leads       2
* Senior Staff           3
* Staff/Psuedo           3
* Alpha/Beta             4
* Users                  5
```

Everything functions in the above order, including who receives what information and when (Levels)

If you have an issue with a staff, you'd bring it up to your Department Lead or theirs (if they don't share departments), this allows us to quickly handle an issue without complicating things... if a Department Lead can't resolve it then it goes to the Staff Manager and Admins.

#### _General Information_

So we've covered chain of command, and all the policy but... what are the departments and who does what? **Time to go over all this!**

**The departments are as follows.**

```
Community
-----------
The staff who interact with the users; Social Media, Public Relations, and Events.

Concept
-----------
The Server Staff, and Developers; Repair Team, and Development.

Assistance
-----------
The Support and Help department; Support Staff, and Translators.

Hiring
-----------
The elite, the mighty; These are the selected people who assist with hirng/evaluations.
```

**Staff Duties**

The general staff duties aren't super difficult to be honest, we just ask you do your jobs... Your job being one of the above departments; so being productive with content, schedule events, or helping people.

If you have perms on the server we ask you don't abuse them. You were given them with trust, don't abuse that. If you can kick, don't kick random users. If you can ban, don't ban random users.

"With great power comes great responsibility." -A ton of famous people


**Conflicts and Greivances**

Alright, so what if you are having a problem with a user or a staff?

Time to talk about our greivance process... So as I said above for the Chain of Command, takes issues to your superiors and if they don't have an answer then it'll go up the C.O.C., if you have an issue with reporting stuff to your Supervisor just talk to the Staff Manager, or another Admin. 

If you, or another user, feel how the management dealt with an issue you can 'apeal' the issue 7-21 days later. We want time for everyone to calm down, if it still an issue just grab another Management staff and talk to the user who made the decision. We want things to be figured out calmly and smoothly.

If you have any questions, just ask your C.O.C.

## **Concept Manual**

The guidelines to do's and do-not's with your jobs as Concept staff!

Concept staff, the people who do the behind the scenes work for our most prominent features. You guys handle our site, graphics, and discord server. Without these people we'd be on our butt's in the snow.

**You guys create the image of what people see the service as**

Where community shows people our character, and what we do... you guys show off how we run.

* Appropriate for all Audiences; Everything we do needs to be 13+ **at least**
* Professional, but fun; We need to look neat and orderly, but we want to be as fun as possible! Don't be bores!!!!
* Timely; Timing is key, if you are given a dealdine... please meet it. We try to push content as fast as possible.

This job is one of the most demanding because you are constantly given a list of tasks to do, some are optional and some aren't. We appreciate all the work you guys put in nonetheless.

---

## **Community Manual**

This will be the key to your job as a staff working on Community aspects. 

As a community staff you duties are to the Community as the name says. This comes with a few core responsibilities.

**You are a public figure for our server, people SEE you.**
* We expect you to be friendly, open, and pleasent to everyone. Does this mean you can't have bad days... no. We just expect you to cope with them appropriately.
* You are expected to put your best foot forward; taking breaks when angry, and preparing for things before hand are key.
* Don't get mad, get glad. If people drop crap on you, take it in stride. We expect trolls and assholes will mess with you, don't let it touch you... you are amazing if we hired you.

You may be curious what exactly your duties are? You main duty is to make us look good, just being honest. You show everyone what our staff are like, and what we stand for. **If you don't look good, that reflects back on us.**

This is one of the more pressuring roles... but it's also a hella fun job, who doesn't like running events and walking up to strangers about our service?

---

## _**Assistance Manual**_

This is our bible. We will add things to this as we find them.

The basics of support staff... Everything you guys do shows how we feel towards people. You guys are the help hotline; you assist people.

**Some core things:**
 
* Friendly; You need to be approachable by people, and seem open to help.
* Quick on your feet; Get there fast, and be ready to help.
* Reliable; Can you be expected to be there when needed?
* Knowledgeable; Do you know what you need to know to help? Are you willing to learn?

These are the core things you need to do this job! If you can meet these, or at least hit close... you will be just fine!

### _Support Guidelines_

_(Written by Koopa, and formatted by Jet)_

So, there are some general guidelines we should follow here. 

* 1.1 One supporting at a time

```
If a support member is already working a client, please do not butt in. _If you
think that something else needs to be said_, either pm the current support working
the case, or ping them somewhere the client cannot see (hint hint, #support-staff).
If more than one support jumps in, it makes it difficult for the user and they don’t
know who to reply to.
If the user posts and more than one support jumps in at the initial greeting, discuss
in #support-staff who will take the case!

Philosophy:
What I was modelling it off of was what we do at my work. Only one person is on the
phone with the client at one time. However, said support may mute the phone to ask a
question that the customer cannot hear. My supervisor might come into the office and 
ask me to double check something with them, or may tell me to hang up the phone and 
send it to him. He might come to me asking for clarification on the notes.

#support would act like the phone call. One support, one user. 
#support-staff would be like the office, they can trade ideas and give more information
```

* 1.2 Multiple users

```
If there are multiple clients in chat needing help, there are a few ways to go about
things. You can ask in a staff chat to see if there is another support available, or
you can try and manage two at once.
When there are more than one clients needing help, I find it useful to specify at the
beginning of your sentance who you are talking to (ping optional). This gives clear 
communication as to who you are helping, and what you need each person to try. This 
also goes if there are multiple supports with multiple clients.

If you see one support struggling with multiple clients, ask them if they need help 
away from the clients (pm or staff chat). If they say they have it, don’t butt in 
(trust me, you’ll confuse everyone). If they say yes, pick one client and say 
“Hey Jet, I’ll be helping you now. Can you try X?” 

Make sure to read what has been done already!
```
* 1.3 Handoff

```
If you reach an area where you don’t know how to proceed (and you’ve done your 
googling/searching), let the client know that you don’t know how to proceed as 
you’ve checked everything you know and say you’ll ask around. If you know somebody
that has handled the topic before, see if they can help through pms or staff channels.
If you just ping them in support channel, you might catch them at a time where they 
can’t help (same reason why you don’t cold call people). Pinging them elsewhere also 
allows them to read back and see what’s happened. If you haven’t seen the issue before,
ask in a staff chat to see if anybody else on support recognizes it.

A handoff would be

In #support 
* 1) I'm sorry $USER, I'm at a loss. I'm going to check to see if anybody else knows.
_In #support-staff_ 
* 1) Hey, @support, does anybody know about X?
* 2) Oh, ya, I do. Let me take it.
_In #support_ 
* 2) Hello $USER, I know about X. Let me help you here. Have you tried...
From then on, only the second support should be working with the user. 
The first should completely step back from #support and let them do their thing.
```

* 1.4 Follow a thread

```
Often times, you need a place to jump off of to find the issue. Ask the first thing 
that comes to your mind, and follow the thread until it reaches a conclusion (even 
if that conclusion is “Okay, nothing’s wrong with the server settings”).
```

* 1.5 Don’t assume!

```
Don’t assume you know what the user’s issue is without proof. Ask a few leading 
questions before giving an answer. Pinpoint it down to what exactly the user’s 
issue is. If it’s with a bot or other outside application direct them there, 
but assume it is our (Discord’s) problem first.
```

* 1.6 Does that make sense?

```
A (semi-annoying) verbal tic that I’ve picked up is asking “Does that make sense?” 
This allows the user to confirm that ‘yes, they do understand’ or ‘no, I’m still 
confused’. Some other variations are “Just to make sure, can you repeat what I 
said?” (can come across as rude) or to give a summary. “So in short, your discord
will not work on a potato.”
```

* 1.7 DM at your own risk

```
The reason to not use dms I learned when I was helping with SexualRhino's music bot.
After you open that method of communication, that person has a high chance to dm you
random questions in the future instead of coming to the server. If you’re fine with
that risk and telling them to leave you alone, go ahead.
```

### _FAQ and Copypasta_
Some questions are common and pretty basic to answer, but are so frequent we need some copypasta.

* 2FA

```
2FA stands for Two Factor Authentication. This means that along with needing
your password to log in, you require the second application (normally on a phone).
This means if someone else tries to log in, they need your password AND your
physical device. Enabling it on a server means that everybody who wants to do any
deleting/kicking/banning needs to have it enabled. This is a security measure to
make sure nobody can mess up your server from a leaked password.
```

* Webhook

```
A webhook is a link that certain services or programs are able to 
quickly send information to and have it posted. With a normal bot account,
you require the token to make sure it’s really the bot owner doing things. 
With webhooks, a person only needs the link They can be easily deleted and 
recreated at any point. Webhooks are not users, they are just an easier way 
to post anonymous messages.
```

* Expired invite

```
An invite can become expired for a few reasons
1) It was set on a timer, and that timer has expired
2) You are banned from that server
3) Someone who has the same IP as you is banned from that server
4) You are in 100 servers already
```

* I can’t edit my role!

```
You cannot edit your highest role in the hierarchy. If it is the highest role
you have, it will have a padlock next to the name in the settings. You also 
cannot assign this to others. Only the owner can bypass this.
```

* Users are randomly getting kicked from my server!

```
Make sure you have no rogue staff. Make sure that your invites are not set to
“temporary membership” (so give them a fresh, unmodified invite). And as a test,
remove management roles from your bots.
```

* Every message people send is getting read out

```
Check your settings under User Settings>Notifications. At the top right, 
set the circle button to Never.
```

* What is the backend of Discord?

```
There's a comment where Jake (Discord Dev) said the backend is Python, 
Exlixir, and C++.
And Stan (other staff) said, "Servers are Elixir/Erland, C++. Python UI is
React, Flux, Elctron. Voice is WebRTC with tons of mods.
```

## **Hiring Manual**

The basics in's and out's of the Hiring process, and what we expect of you.

This process is very very important to our functioning, no departments would run without staff; so we need staff to hire the other staff. (Clever right?)

As the people in charge of making sure the best of the best are hired, we need you on the top of your game with interviews and looking over evaluations.

* Analytical; We want to be nice, but if someone is bullshitting you... slam them against the wall.
* Honest; Again, we want to be nice but if someone's doing something wrong... tell them.
* Thoughtful; Don't rush into decisions, look into the details and ask questions.
* Detailed; Make sure you don't let stuff escape your notice, if possible. 

We know no one is perfect, but these are only guidelines. We just need consistant staff who are willing to read through and conduct interviews. Nothing is better then a solid hiring team, one that can operate outside the normal staff spectrum even.

#### _Hiring Tools_

Most of the below stuff is explained vaguely across the servers, and the interview questions cover material already on the Application form but you guys don't all get to see that... plus we need to make sure they are consistant right?

* Interview Quesitons

```
* What Staff role are you applying for?
* So why are you interested in becoming a Staff on the Guide?
* What motivates you to want to do this volunteer job?
* Do you have any past experience with this field?
* What skills do you have that make you a good candidate for this job?
* How active are you on Discord? How much time can you put into your job for us?
* What does our service mean to you? What are we about?
* Have you read the guides? If so, what do you think of them?
* Being honest, what if we refused you this job right now?
* Why should we hire you over any other applicants?
```

* Evaluation Process

```
The evaluation is all about proving they know how to work with servers; this has no 
bearing on their general discord knowledge. The whole goal is to prove they can handle 
setting up a server, using some creative idea to base it upon. We want only the best as 
staff... right?

The evaluation channel on the staff server explains more, but the basics is they are 
given 5 channels with full control of them. They take those 5 channels and turn it into 
a mini-server, names, roles, permissions, and content on them.

Feel the pressure.
```

* Staff Limits

```
So we obviously can't keep adding staff forever, but where do we cut our losses?

We want aproximitely 1 staff for every 30-50 members (average of 40), this can vary
based on whether the staff is part of Concept, Community, Assistance, or Hiring.

Basicly; At 1000 users we should have 25-30 staff, the ratio should be kept as we
grow... unless activity begins to drop, then the staff count will do the same.

Hiring/Firing is very subjective, and depends on the circumstances.

```
