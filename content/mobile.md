## Mobile Guides

Due to the difficulty in writing these, we havent finished these for the public yet!

Feel free to offer suggestions for what should have here to Jet#0038
It's very hard to write guides for something you don't use **;_;**

If you want to join the team, and help write these... how about you just message Jet? He'll feel sad if he can't get help on this content.

We will try to get these online as soon as possible eitherway!

**Thanks for your support as always <3**
