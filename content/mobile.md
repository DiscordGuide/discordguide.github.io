# Mobile Server Management


**Hey Guys!!**
Everything here is taken on Discord iOS v. 1.7.6, iPhone 6, my bot account, iOS 10.1 dev beta 3.

So, I assume you're here because you want to know how and what to do when creating a server using Discord's all holy mobile app. Well, here we go. 

Upon first clicking upon the big ol' plus, you'll be greeted with this humble screen.

![]()

Obviously we're not here to join a server, that's easy, silly! We are here to teach you how to MAKE a server. 

Now, click that lovely **Create** button on the top. After that, you should have this display bestowed upon you.

![]()

Ok, now type in a name, put in an icon if you'd like, and set the server region. 
After that, hit that fancy **Create** button and... and.... BOOM!

Your very own Discord server, able to mass flag videos, order a pizza, and it's 100% Ad Free and it mains Tracer! 

For the sake of demo, I'm naming my server Example. 
After creating the server, you'll be brought back to the last page you were on and you would instantly be put into the voice chat that it auto-created, General.  

Now, you're in and it should look like this.

 ![]()

Now, it's very blank and empty, and you're lonely in here. It's fine. 
I lived elementary school like that... But anyways! 
You should probably get everything set up and working! So, click the three bars, or slide right, and you should see where your text and voice channels are. 

Hit the server name up top, and some options should come up.

Alright, now in **Notification Settings** you can change the way the notifications work on the server. And that page looks like this.

Ok, moving along, and this is a hefty one. **Server Settings**. I tried to fit everything into the section. Here's how it looks like.

  ![]()

Ok, the first thing here is the icon. You can change that from this page. Not the server name though. You have to change that in....... *drum roll* 
  
**Overview!**

---

*Server Name* changes the server name. 

*Server Region* changes the server region. 

*AFK Channel* changes the AFK channel. *AFK Timeout* is the time they have before being deemed AFK and being moved to the AFK channel. 

*Verification Level* allows you to change the minimum needed to chat on your server. There are four settings.

**None** 
  means anyone can chat. Even the undocumented Discordians.

**Low** 
means that the people with an email lverified on Discord can talk on there. Only the citizens

**Medium** 
means that the people also need to be registered on Discord for longer than 5 minutes. Only the long-term residents allowed. 

**(╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻** 
means that the people also need to be a member on the server for longer than 10 minutes. Looks like only the elite.

*Default Notification Settings* will determine what notifications people will get if they didn;t set any settings themselves.

**⚠ DELETE SERVER ⚠** deletes the entire server. This is irreversable so I suggest we keep that away from public's eye.

Alright, now we head back to the main **Overview** tab. The next page is **Integrations**

---

In this page, it displays all the integrations that the server has with other platforms like Twitch. If there are none, then it displays this screen.

  ![]()

Ok let's head back. 

---

**Security** allows you to enable server-wide two-factor authentication. 2FA makes it so that people with admin powers has to have 2FA enabled on their accounts. Only the owner can enable it, and they need 2FA to be able to do so. 2FA makes it so that you need to use a third-party app to give you a code to log in, unless already logged in.
 
  ![]()

Alright, back a page.

---

**Members** allows you to view the member list. You can tap into a name to do some basic functions like adding a nickname, editing their roles, or to kick/ban them.

**Roles** allows you to edit the roles. You can add some roles, delete some, and edit the role settings! 
Maybe make your friend less powerful. They need to stop abusing their power, eh?

To go through the major ones: 

**Administrator** means that they have each and every permission, and it overrides any and all restrictions. Very risky, so turn on 2FA if you don't trust them all too much. 

**Manage Server** is the setting used to determine if the role can change anything in the **Overview** tab and delete instant invites.

**Manage Roles** is the setting used if that person can edit the roles. Make a new one, delete one, change the settings, only on the roles below them.

**Manage Channels** is the setting associated with being able to edit the text and voice channels. Maybe make the permissions, add them, remove them. 

Everything else is pretty self-explanatory.

---

Ok, now back to the main **Settings** page.  

**Instant Invites** look like this. 

  ![]()

It really lists all the instant invites that were handed out from the server. 
Tap the three bubbles next to an invite to choose to share or revoke the invite.

---

Now onto the final section of the settings. Bans. 

So, here's a screenshot!

  ![]()

Here, you can see all the people that have been banned from the server, including bots.  Tap their name to unban them.

Now, that's about it!

**Mobile currently has a GLITCH in Server Settings in which you would be able to access "Roles" in a server, as long as you have a permission that allows you to open the "Server Settings" tab. No "Manage Roles" needed. You can't edit anything but you can peek into the different permissions, as long as they are not locked.**
