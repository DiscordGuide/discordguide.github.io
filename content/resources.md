## **Discord Tricks**

**MEOW!** This guide is by far my favorite. Here I get to let you know all the secrets, and funny little tricks discord has up its sleeve.
*(Trust me, there are a lot)*

So where shall I begin? How about the text tricks!

#### _Information and fun facts_

Your game message can hold 128 characters (letters/spaces/symbols)

Your normal messages can hold 2000 characters (letters/spaces/symbols)

You are judged on your user icons. **fun fact**

You can’t be more famous than abalabahaha and B1nzy unless you are Voltana.

Discord was made/launched in March 2015

I have no life... _wait this one isn't fun._

Why cant we be friends? Because I’m too busy.

**Got any others I should add?**

**Maybe you just think my hat is funny? Let me know! (I admit my hat is funny ;_; )**

#### _Text and Styles_

So have you ever seen people highlight, cross through, italicize, or bold their words?
Well here I get to show you how this is done.

Discord makes all these work using some funny symbol combinations, using Markdown:

Wait... what about programming languages? You are saying you can make these boxes (last one) show the programming code with different colors in order to help developers?

![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/232878512502079488/232919505825693696/unknown.png)

Here are three examples for javascript, python, and ruby. A list of accepted languages is available [here](https://highlightjs.org/static/demo/). You can also see how the code is colored by choosing "Solarized Dark" from "Styles" on the left sidebar of that page.

Next?

#### _Colors and Pictures Fun_

Colors? 
_OHHH Role Colors!_

You can use colors by going into the roles and click the white square on each role (next to the grey one by the color table)

Colors are fun right? Well here is my role color guide for Invisible on Dark Theme, Light Theme, and basic colors I just like to use!

![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/232878512502079488/232920007976288257/unknown.png)

If you have colors you'd like to suggest I add, or think of any other kewl kolors... just tell our staff on the server in off-topic!

Pictures?

_Pictures are fun._
Something I like to do for my servers is put banners on my welcome channels with clear backgrounds so they blend in. 

A good site for making these is http://www197.lunapic.com/. Just go to "Edit" and then Transparent! (Make sure the background is a solid color)

Sadly, i'm not a picture expert so I can't say much more... but this can be handy when doing custom emotes like I discuss below!

#### _Name Game_

Your name and your games.

Ever wanted to do something fun with your name or your game?
How about emotes? Well some emotes off the chat you can copy and paste to your name!

How about invisible? Copy/paste this! [INSERT]

*Also, hint about your game. It starts *"Playing ______" **so a good one is "Playing with a roller coaster" not "Playing roller coaster"**

Games are fun, it's Discords way of having a status message. Just please... don't use your servers invite link. Some servers **will** warn/kick/ban you for it.

#### _Custom Emotes_

OH MY GOD, EMOTES!

Alright this is fun, we have two kinds now!
The 1st is every server, that’s right, every server. You can add emotes under Servers settings - Emojis!
![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/232878512502079488/232920420003741696/unknown.png)

The second is through BTTV emote servers which have GLOBAL emotes!

At the top of these guides check out the "Resource Servers" area I mention, "The Portal" has a list of these servers that still exist!

Global emotes might be a thing one day... but for now, spam those emotes that were bad by your bad self!

#### _User Status_

Wait… NO WAY
Just like skype you get to set your own status now!

The options are Online, Idle, Do Not Disturb, and Invisible… Oooooo invisibleeee

To do these just click your icon on the bottom left on Desktop and Voila!
--insert image-

*Now you can be the lurker you always wanted to be…*

**Make sure you read all the other guides!**

## **Advanced Discord Tools** #

**OH JEEZ....** Hello.

You're probably wondering what's gonna be here... I decided to cover some of the less used or less common features on Discord...
I thought _"Hey! These things should probably have a guide since I'm already doing this."_ and no one decided to stop me. 

So here we go. First let's start with my favorite mode of all!

#### _Developer Mode_ #

**Here we are again,** I briefly touched on this during the User Settings, but I feel it is important to know about this tool.

Developer mode allows a user to grab the IDs of any object in Discord, from message to user, from bot to channel. These ID's allow easy access shortcuts to channels, and mentioning a user.

![](http://i.imgur.com/viZYSnL.png)

Just click that option on the user, BOOM you copied there ID.

Once you have an ID you can do a few things with it.

![](http://i.imgur.com/kwwY9u7.png)

So as it says, <#INSERT ID> will mention a channel, and <@INSERT ID> will mention a user. These will work **no matter where you are** but if someone doesn't share a server with that user, or have that server with that channel... it'll just look like <#CHANNEL-ID> not #channel.

Developer mode can be fun, and is very useful for bots and trying to report spammers but... there is no but.

Keep on down the list for more stuff!

#### _Key Commands_ #

For keyboard combos, I have some information that might help with those!
  
![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/232878512502079488/232920668537094144/unknown.png)
  
and the way to find this list? Just type these into the chat on desktop...

`ctrl + /` = windows open list
`cmd + /` = mac open list

I will go more into detail on these as soon as I can!

#### _Discriminators_ #

**What's a discriminator >_<**

You know that funny thing that follows your name? For example, mine is Jet**#0038** those 4 numbers after the # are your discriminator. These allow discord to have multiple users with the same name... but easily keep track of them.

A user can have symbols, letters, and spaces in their names... but what if someone had the EXACT same name.

Say someon came up as had the name Jet, how would you know we were different? Yeah you probably could use icons, but I change my icon alot.. don't I? That Jet would just need to change their icon a lot and we'd both get mixed up eventually... plus how the heck would you mention us?

Having disciminations allows easy access to that **one** user you are looking for.

But why is this a guide? That was all pretty basic you say?

_WELL_ What if you wanted to change yours? Ever seen some kool kat with a #6969 discrim, or my bad self with a #0038 discrim? Well now you can get one of those also!

**Things you need**

• A bot, such as Aethex, with a Discrim search commands. (On Aethex it is -dir u d ????)

• Ability to change your username.

• Okay with being dissapointed here and there.
  
So how does this work? Simple.

If you're discrim is to seperate you and another user with the same name... what would happen if you changed your name to exactly the same name as someone with the same Discrim...? Yours would change. **BOOM**

So say I use -dir u d 6609 and got a result

![](blob:http://imgur.com/ad7570b5-3815-4d39-8d81-0c30f82dccef)
  
Now I have these options to change my name, any one of these would change my discrim **forever**, you can always change it AGAIN, but you can't do a _Nevermind I want the old one!!!_ **You don't get to choose the new one!**

There you go, that's how discrims work. If you have questions, shoot us a line! If not, just continue down the page!

#### _2FA_ #

**Waittttttttt, what is this 2FA thingy...?**

2FA is Two Factor Authentication, this allows users to improve security on their accounts by requiring passcodes from alternate application to be able to get into the account and do anything major (Such as deleting a server, or Changing your password.)

2FA is an extremely useful tool for protection of your account, you can find it under the Security User setting. (Which we showed in the Discord Basics)

![](http://i.imgur.com/JsWlYQ3.png)

Just to to the page shown above, and click enable. 

![](blob:http://imgur.com/b95203da-d7b2-4ab1-bb73-f29eb05861f7)

Once you have done that, take the information that pops up and input it into a 2FA application such as Authy, Authenticator, or Google Authenticator. Most of these will take the image, but you can use the manual code instead.

As soon as you've done that, you just need to enter the code it gave you. (If you accidently click out, that's fine. Just repeat the process.)

Once that's been completed you now have 2FA, you will need your backup codes or your authenticator application to log in. To make any changes you will need to application though. **So don't lose it!**

If you have any more questions, just ask!

#### _Webhooks_ #

We're working on getting a comprehension webhook guide to put here.

_Please bear with us :D_

**That's all she said folks!**

**Feel free to hop around the guides to find more stuff or just head to our server to hang out and maybe ask some questions!**
