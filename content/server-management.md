# Server Management Guides

Here are all our tips and tricks to getting your server **just right.**

## Advanced Server Information

**Already here, huh?** We'll be covering more detailed server edits, and tools here.

By now you should have some members joining, and gotten a good grasp of what you are doing. These will help you for later down the road, or even things you may just decide to add.

### Server Settings

So these are a bit more basic and I could probably add them earlier, but by now you know your way around enough to do these things.

Look at your "Overview" tab on "Server Settings"

* **"Verification Levels"** are the levels of being able to send a message if a user doesn't meet these they cannot send messages to the server.  **(This is canceled out by roles, so be careful when giving out roles to new people!)**

* **"Default Notifications"**: Good practice for this is to have these set to "@mentions only" so that way people aren't spammed with every message.

* **"AFK channel"** is where people go when they go AFK for a certain amount of time, moving them off one Voice Channel and into another you decide is the AFK channel.

* The **"Location"** location of your server changes how the Voice Channels work, and how good reception your members have. Most worldwide servers use US-East as a default area, if your server is more specific then you can set it for your area. 

* **Limbo Rooms and Limbo Servers**

You are probably like, "What."

Limbo Rooms and Limbo Servers are rooms or servers that require a Staff approving you to move past into other rooms, or the rest of the server. Most membership-based servers have these so people joining can decide if they will follow the rules or not, and accept the consequences if they break them.

*These are a lot like restricted rooms I mentioned in the last channel*

A limbo room is pretty easy to make, remember how you set those staff rooms and special perks rooms? We are doing the opposite here. 
Every channel in the server requires a base room to see, and not having those limits you to seeing the welcome room and a channel where you can request to join the rest of the server; some servers even have bots you can use to give yourself the role to get out. 
This is a good use for 42 who has the `+giveme` command.

  Limbo rooms and Limbo servers allow you to keep things private and keep a better grasp on who has what permissions and who can join. Unless YOU or a Staff approves it... they can't do anything at all.

  This is a great tool for making private servers you don't want anyone joining if they are stuck on a dead-end channel they'll eventually either get kicked or leave.

* **Inactivity Penalties aka. Prune Members**

This is one of the fun features in Discord, the Inactivity penalties. 

On your "Server Settings" you should see a tab named "Members" at the bottom is an area called 'Prune', this allows you to remove members who haven't said anything for certain amounts of time.

**WARNING:** This does not work on users with roles, so it's not smart to assign every member a role if you want to prune inactive people.

  This allows you to remove members who don't contribute anything to the server.


* **Bans List**

The bans list tab on "Server Settings" is pretty self-explanatory. You can ban/unban people using this, and the member list tab allows you to kick, ban, or even give your Ownership of the server over to any other member.


* **Instant Invites**

This tab on "Server Settings" allows you to cancel any invite link made, or see how many members each one has been used to get for the server. 
This is great for tracking statistics, and seeing who has done a lot of recruiting.


* **Voice Chat Magic**
Your voice chat causes glitching? or maybe it's fine but you want it better?

Well on the Voice Chat you can decide maximum member limits, and decide the MBPS for the Voice Channel. The higher the MBPS, the higher the quality (and lag) the lower, the lesser the quality (and lag)

Member limits allow you to restrict how many people are talking or are listening to the music bot, etc.


This has been the first server management guide!

## Running a Server

**Well, hello!** Guess you’re here for more server management tips right?

Yeah… thought so. Sorry, I don't have as many pictures this time ?? 

Alright, so we’re going to go over the fundamentals of running a server. Without these key pieces, a server isn’t going to do too well, unless it’s a specialty server and even then what happens when it isn’t special anymore?

A lot of servers try to base things only on a unique concept and don’t establish themselves as more, they don’t strengthen the server's functionality.

This is what I want to try to help you guys fix, or prepare for.


### Idea and Concept
I may sound like a broken record, but don’t run away!

The whole point of your server is key, you need to have an appealing idea with a well-made concept.

If you are just like “OH I WANT A FANDOM SERVER!!!!!!!” and don’t put the effort into seeing if there are other servers and exploiting something they don’t have, then don’t be sad if your server doesn’t grow. 
It isn’t as easy as just making the server ?? 


### Organization

Sorry but… a sloppily organized server first of all just doesn't look nice, next of all it’s just plain hard to function.

If you can’t put the time into cleaning it up and organizing it, your members could get confused about things or get lost. I’ve seen someone gets lost in a server, I mean… it had 94 channels *BUT STILL.*

Organized server? Here’s an example in my mind

### Communication

So the next few are kinda about your staff and member relations.

Communication is big, letting your members know about updates and making sure your staff knows what is going on in the server. 
I myself like to know what’s going on, and if I am in a server without communication… I rarely will stay.


### Understanding

Understanding? This means a lot. Not just understanding what you're doing with your server but understanding the members.

You need to be able to be open to feedback from your members, and improve as new ideas are made. It’s the main thing Discord functions around. Discord get’s its concepts from the suggestions area of the site. 
Sure the staff comes up with stuff, most of them use or used Discord as server members, **BUT** we say what we want to see and they try to meet that. Server owners can learn a lot from that.


### Trust

No staff team is perfect, but finding those you trust… what happens if you vanish? Who’ll run things?
And your permissions? Who can you trust to do what?

Trust is a big thing on a server, not in just the staff but in deciding what people can do.

Posting pictures? Links? Making instant invites? These are all permissions you TRUST your members to have or not have.

Catch my drift?


If you want more stuff on expanding your server just keep scrolling, if not then go about your day!


Remember, help is offered on the server, suggestions are always loved too.

## Growing a Server

**Weeelllllllllllll** We’ve gone over just about everything server wise I can think of… except how to actually grow your server!

So we went over the basics and all that jazz… let’s talk growth.


### Ideals
Well, guess we’re back to this! Not really, this is slightly different.

“Ideals? What are those…?” 
Well… where do you want your server to go? What are your dreams for this server? 44,000 members? Or maybe just 40? Getting an image of where you want to go is the core of your growth.


### Content and Ability

What **content** is on your server? Do you have lots of unique ideas and strong guidelines? Do you have people interested in the channels on your server?

How is your **Ability** as an Owner? How well is your server setup? How much do you know about the topic it’s based around?

Having these two working together will give people a reason to join, while your Ideals decides what you're going for.


### Advertisement
There are SO MANY WAYS to advertise.

Ever heard of server lists? Well, Discord has quite a few.
*These lists fall into two categories:*
_`*`_ Bot to Site lists
   Bot’s that track your server and posts your server as an advertisement on a site
_`*`_ Server lists
   Server’s that allow you to post, or ask them to post your server in categories or on one large list.

### Members
The last piece is members.

No server can grow without members, which means you need to have a member base.

You may be asking, “How does having members make me grow…? Isn’t that the goal?” but, a good server will have members who share it with their friends. One person sharing a server with 10 people, then that person sharing it with 10, etc that’s 100 which can easy keep spreading.

This also means you have to be careful with rules and making sure you have good kick/ban policies. I know I haven’t covered these much but I feel they are pretty straight forward:
Kick - removed from server, can rejoin
Ban - removed from server, can’t rejoin


Alright, hope this guide helped!
