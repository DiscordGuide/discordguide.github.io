# Discord Tricks/Tools

These are resources for knowledge; random tricks, tips, and other material that doesn't fit under the other categories.

## **The Tricks**

**MEOW!** This guide is by far my favorite. Here I get to let you know all the secrets, and funny little tricks discord has up its sleeve.
*(Trust me, there are a lot)*

So where shall I begin? How about the text tricks!

#### *Information and fun facts*

Your game message can hold 128 characters (letters/spaces/symbols)

Your normal messages can hold 2000 characters (letters/spaces/symbols)

You are judged on your user icons. **fun fact**

You can’t be more famous than abalabahaha and B1nzy unless you are Voltana.

Discord was made/launched in March 2015

I have no life... *wait this one isn't fun.*

Why cant we be friends? Because I’m too busy.

**Got any others I should add?**

**Maybe you just think my hat is funny? Let me know! (I admit my hat is funny ;_; )**

#### *Formatting*

Here's the first tool you should have in your toolbox.
**Formatting**

Formatting changes the game with everything; invites, information, and even simply talking to others.

If you can master the formats, then you can master anything. (Not really, you just look nice while being an idiot)

*Where to begin...* Discord Markdown!

This is fun stuff right here. This is how everyone does things like **bold** or *italics*

Well this is all done via symbols you add around the words, as shown in below image.

And for mentioning objects?

The combinations are *almost* endless!

*And next...?* Emotes!?

Wait... don't emotes express feelings or reactions to things...? Why the heck would emotes be in formatting.

Well you'd be kinda right... they do express feelings or reactions, so wouldn't they potentially help emphasize your point in an announcement or information panel?

Well, using emotes vs not using.. such a hard decision. **o_o**

![](http://i.imgur.com/8yv3xgq.png)

In the above image... what is the difference you see? Which one stands out more? I personally prefer the emotes one, it allows you to emphasize your point and give people visual things they can see and relate things to.

But all of this is useless without the next piece... (Unless you want smaller titles than your emotes that you are using.)

*So lastly...* Highlight.js   **O3O**

**I will be posting these soon.... very soon™**

#### *Name Game*

Your name and your games.

Ever wanted to do something fun with your name or your game?
How about emotes? Well some emotes off the chat you can copy and paste to your name!

(To find these use the discord default, not custom, emotes and put a \ before it then copy the symbol it gives.)

*Also, hint about your game. It starts *"Playing ______" _so a good one is "Playing **with a roller coaster**" not "Playing **roller coaster**"_

Games are fun, it's Discords way of having a status message. Just please... don't use your servers invite link. Some servers **will** warn/kick/ban you for it.

#### *Custom Emotes*

OH MY GOD, EMOTES!

Alright this is fun, we have two kinds now!

The 1st is every server, that’s right, every server. You can add emotes under Servers settings - Emotes!

The second is through BTTV emote servers which have GLOBAL emotes! (Check the [server guides](index.html#/servers/emadvertisementem) for the server lists!)

**Global emotes... those are a bit tricky!**

There are *two* ways to have global emotes right now.

* BTTV (Twitch Streamer Globals)

* Nitro ('Premium' Discord in Beta for Aussies)

So... what do you do if you want global emotes? Either become a twitch streamer with 15+ views 3 times a week, or over 1000 followers... or pay discord moneys for JUST you.

#### *User Status*

Wait… NO WAY
Just like skype you get to set your own status now! The options are..

* Online

* Idle

* Do Not Disturb

* Invisible

To do these just click your icon on the bottom left on Desktop and Voila!

*Now you can be the lurker you always wanted to be…* Oooooo invisibleeee

#### *Colors and Pictures, Fun!*

*Colors?*
OHHH Role Colors!

You can use colors by going into the roles and click the white square on each role (next to the grey one by the color table)

Colors are fun right? Well here is my role color guide for Invisible on Dark Theme, Light Theme, and basic colors I just like to use!

*Pictures?*
Pictures are fun.

Something I like to do for my servers is using clear background images so they blend in. These graphics allow you to emphasize things, and can make really good information channel headers!

A good site for making these is [Lunapic](http://www197.lunapic.com/upload). Just go to "Edit" and then Transparent! (Make sure the background is a solid color)

Sadly, i'm not a picture expert so I can't say much more... but this can be handy when making custom emotes!

## **The Tools**

**OH JEEZ....** Hello.

You're probably wondering what's gonna be here... I decided to cover some of the less used or less common features on Discord...
I thought *"Hey! These things should probably have a guide since I'm already doing this."* and no one decided to stop me.

#### *Key Commands*

For keyboard combos, I have some information that might help with those!

![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/232878512502079488/232920668537094144/unknown.png)

and the way to find this list? Just type these into the chat on desktop...

`ctrl + /` = windows open list
`cmd + /` = mac open list

I will go more into detail on these as soon as I can!

#### *Discriminators*

**What's a discriminator >_<**

You know that funny thing that follows your name? For example, mine is Jet**#0038** those 4 numbers after the # are your discriminator. These allow discord to have multiple users with the same name... but easily keep track of them.

A user can have symbols, letters, and spaces in their names... but what if someone had the EXACT same name?

Say someone came up as had the name Jet, how would you know we were different? Yeah you probably could use icons, but I change my icon alot.. don't I? That Jet would just need to change their icon a lot and we'd both get mixed up eventually... plus how the heck would you mention us? **O_O**

Having disciminations allows easy access to that **one** user you are looking for.

*But why is this a guide? That was all pretty basic you say?*

*WELL* What if you wanted to change yours? Ever seen some kool kat with a #6969 discrim, or my bad self with a #0038 discrim? Well now you can get one of those also!

**This will soon be a thing, working on some stuff for it...**

(The devs will forever hate you for doing this <_< )

#### *2FA*

**Waittttttttt, what is this 2FA thingy...?**

2FA is Two Factor Authentication, this allows users to improve security on their accounts by requiring passcodes from alternate application to be able to get into the account and do anything major.

Such as...

* Deleting a server
* Changing your email
* Changing your password

This also allows you to 2FA enable a server which means only 2FA users can do anything above normal member permissions.

2FA is an extremely useful tool for protection of your account, you can find it under the Security User setting. (Which we showed in [Desktop Basics](index.html#/desktop/emsecurityem))

![](http://i.imgur.com/JsWlYQ3.png)

Just to to the page shown above, and click enable.

![](http://i.imgur.com/tBNn7vB.png)

Once you have done that, take the information that pops up and input it into a 2FA application such as Authy, Authenticator, or Google Authenticator. Most of these will take the image, but you can use the manual code instead.

For example... I use my tablet as my 2FA, it's windows so I go to the windows store and download *for free* the "2 Factor Authenticator" app, and now I have a 2FA application!

As soon as you've done that, you just need to enter the code it gave you. (If you accidently click out, that's fine. Just repeat the process to get another code.)

Once that's been completed you now have 2FA, you will need your backup codes or your authenticator application to log in. To make any changes you will need to application though. **So don't lose it!*

If you have any more questions, just ask in our server!

#### *Webhooks and Embeds*

We're working on getting a comprehensive webhooks and embed guide here!!

_Please bear with us **:D**_
